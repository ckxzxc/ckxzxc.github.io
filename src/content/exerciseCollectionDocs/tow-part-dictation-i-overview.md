## Description
Our exercises use ABC notation. If you're new to it, check out [ABC notation examples](https://abcnotation.com/examples) for a quick guide and reference.

Each exercise includes an ABC notation template and a reference audio track. The staves are filled with rests, except for the first note. Listen to the audio as many times as needed, and enter what you hear into the ABC notation editor to complete the excerpt. 

**Note!!** In some notation templates (3/4 and 6/8 times), dotted whole rests and dotted half rests may not rendered correctly, they appear as whole or half rests instead. This does not affect the function of the exercise or how your answers are evaluated.

## Notation Guidelines

- In our exercises, the unit note length `L: ` is always determined by the beat value in the time signiture. For example:
    - In **3/4** time, the unit note length is a quarter note: `L:1/4` .
    - In **6/8** time, the unit note length is an eighth note: `L:1/8` .
- We use `/` instead of `/n` to half a note.
- Write notes using their shortest rhythmic value within the givin unit length. For instance, with `L: 1/4` :
    - A middle C quarter note is written as `C`. Though `C2/` produces the same result and is technically correct, it won't pass the check.
    - A dotted quarter middle C should be written as `C3/`, and a dotted eighth middle C is `C3//`.
- Courtesy accidentals are not required.
- No broken rhythm markers will be used in this collection of exercises.

## Hint Mode

Hint mode displays the first note and the last note in each voice, and any accidental notes. Rests are shown in the place of hidden notes, matched their duration. Ties are visible in the editor.

## Evaluation

Your response will be checked against the solution by comparing the ABC string, with all spaces and line breaks removed. Even if the notation renders correctly, editing other parts of the template will cause the answer to be marked incorrect. Extra spaces and line breaks generally won't affect the check, but may cause display issues. Itâ€™s best to stick to the template format.

## Tips
- Click inside the editor after you hitting the reset or hint button to update the notation on the canva.
- You can always write your answer on staff paper and compare it with the solution.
- Having a musical instrument or a keyboard nearby may be helpful.
